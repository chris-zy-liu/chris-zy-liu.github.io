>The lights of the City glowed out<br>Across the River, and across the orange fog.<br>So, come along, we'll entertain the murmurs of the River:<br>A sizzling pan, a barking dog, a humming dryer.<br>Then, we'll step away from the weathered coast,<br>And towards the direction of the moon, forever,<br>For it is only April, do not worry, then, about the lights<br>Across the river.<br><br>We'll find a path paved with cobbled stones<br>And following it—along the River—reach another<br>Old bench facing the sinking moon.<br>And we'll hear dreams and colors<br>And lawns and parlors and flowers and December—<br><br>So, <br>Along the rugged shore covered by a shadow,<br>We'll sing the melodies of mixing pebbles,<br>And hasten our breaths at the sound of Dawn,<br>Covering our eyes in anticipation<br>For the light, the City behind the fog.<br>We'll cross the River,  trying not to drown<br>In more breakfasts and stained collars and canine hollers.<br><br>The moon calls, then, behind the towers of the City;<br>It beckons, then, for you, and for me.
